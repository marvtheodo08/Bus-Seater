# Bus Seater
Welcome to Bus Seater, the world's first bus seating app!
## How it works
There are 3 types of accounts:
- Student Account
- Driver Account
- Admin Account

A student account allows a student to pick their seat for the week, a driver account allows a driver to oversee, and add students to their bus, and an admin account allows a school admin to oversee all the buses.

When a user signs up, they have the option to sign up for any account type. But, when a user signs up for a student account, there is an authetication process to verify is the info is true. Once everything is verified, they are able to pick their seat for the following week.

# Bus Seater
Welcome to Bus Seater, the world's first school bus seating app!
## How it works
There are 3 types of accounts:
- Student Account
- Driver Account
- Admin Account

A student account allows a student to pick their seat for the week, a driver account allows a driver to oversee, and add students to their bus, and an admin account allows a school admin to oversee all the buses.

When a user signs up, they have the option to sign up for any account type. But, when a user signs up for a student account, there is an authetication process to verify is the info is true. Once everything is verified, they are able to pick their seat for the following week.

The student is able to pick their seat starting on the Friday before the following week, and they have until Sunday to pick. On weeks with breaks, they are not able to pick their seats.

A strike system keeps the student in check so they can still pick their seats. If the student does mischivous, the driver is able to block the student from picking their seat for the following weak, and recieve a strike. After three stikes, the student can not pick their seat for the rest of the quarter!

The Admin can set up breaks and the quarters, and they are able to create buses as well.

This app ensures that everyone has a seat they are happy in without rushing the bus, and helps create a healthy, behaved enviroment on the bus.
